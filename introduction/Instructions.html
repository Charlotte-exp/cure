            In this study, you will be randomly paired with another person for a sequence of rounds (= an interaction).
            You will play with the same person for the entire study.
            In each round, you and the other participant have to make a choice.
            The bonus you receive will depend on your choice and the choice of the other participant.
            It is cumulative. Your payoff on every round is summed up and paid to you at the end as a bonus.
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            The interaction will be at least {{ C.min_rounds }} rounds.
            From the {{ C.min_rounds }}th round, there is a {{ delta }}% probability
            that the interaction will continue for at one more round.
            After that round, there will again be a {{ delta }}% chance of yet another round,
            and after that round, there will again be another {{ delta }}% chance of another round, and so on until the tasks end.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            The choices and the payoffs in each round are as follows:
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="form-group required">
        <table class="table table-bordered text-center" style="width: auto; margin: auto">
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2" rowspan="2"></th>
            <th colspan="2">The Other's Choice</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><div class="player_box">Cooperate</div></th>
            <th><div class="player_box">Defect</div></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="2"><div class="white_box">Your Choice</div></th>
            <td><div class="blue_box">Cooperate</div></td>
            <td><div class="white_box"><font color="dodgerblue">{{C.reward}}</font>,
                <font color="red">{{C.reward}}</div></td>
            <td><div class="white_box"><font color="dodgerblue">{{ C.sucker }}</font>,
                <font color="red">{{C.temptation}}</font></div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><div class="blue_box">Defect</div></td>
            <td><div class="white_box"><font color="dodgerblue">{{C.temptation}}</font>,
                <font color="red">{{ C.sucker }}</font></div></td>
            <td><div class="white_box"><font color="dodgerblue">{{C.punishment}}</font>,
                <font color="red">{{C.punishment}}</font></div></td>
        </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
        The first entry in each cell represents your payoff,
        while the second entry represents the payoff of the person you are interacting with.
        You make your choice by clicking directly on the blue box titled 1 for Option 1,
        and 2 for Option 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you can see, this shows the payoff associated with each choice.
        Once you and the person you are paired with have made your choices,
        your payoff for the round will appear.
    </p>
    <p>
        That is, if:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You select 1 and the other selects 1, you each make <b>{{C.reward}}</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            You select 1 and the other selects 2, you make <b>{{ C.sucker }}</b>
            while the other makes <b>{{C.temptation}}</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            You select 2 and the other selects 1, you make <b>{{C.temptation}}</b>
            while the other makes <b>{{ C.sucker }}</b>.
        <li>
            You select 2 and the other selects 2, you each make <b>{{C.punishment}}</b>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        {{ if player.condition == "with_errors" }}
        Sometimes, the choice you or the other participant makes will be recorded wrong.
        If you chose to cooperate, there is a chance that it will be implemented as a defection.
        In case such an error occurs, you will be informed about it, but the other participant will not.
        In particular, the neither you nor the other participant can be sure
        whether the choice you observed was the true decision the participant made.
        These errors occur with a {{ error_rate }}% everytime you or the other participant make a choice.
        It can be never, once, or several times during the whole study.
        {{ endif }}
    </p>
    <p>
        Before we start, recall again that the total number of rounds is randomly determined.
        After each round, there is a {{ delta }}% probability that the interaction will continue for at least another round.
        You will play with the same person for the entire interaction.
